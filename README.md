### 📊 Project Overview

This project was submitted for the [WiDS Datathon 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2025). The goal was to predict:

* **ADHD\_Outcome** (binary classification)
* **Sex\_F** (binary classification: 1 for female, 0 for male)

The dataset includes cognitive, survey, and EEG-derived features.
